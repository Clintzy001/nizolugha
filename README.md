# Lugha Learn: Kenyan, Zambian & Nigerian Languages 🌍

**Lugha Learn** is a mobile-first platform dedicated to preserving and teaching African languages. We focus on high-quality audio, tonal accuracy, and cultural context for languages like Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Bemba, and Nyanja.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision
Most language apps ignore the nuances of African tonality and cultural depth. Our goal is to bridge that gap for the diaspora and local learners alike.

### Key Features
* **Tone-Perfect Learning:** Specialized UI components to help users master tonal marks (e.g., Yoruba/Igbo).
* **Cultural Bites:** Lessons integrated with local history, food (Jollof, Nshima, Ugali), and etiquette.
* **Audio-First Approach:** High-fidelity recordings from native speakers in Nairobi, Lusaka, and Lagos.
* **Offline Mode:** Accessible learning for areas with limited internet connectivity.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)
* **Frontend:** React Native / Expo (Cross-platform iOS & Android)
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (User progress & lesson metadata)
* **Storage:** AWS S3 or Firebase (For audio and image assets)

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/assets`: Branding, icons, and language-specific imagery.
* `/docs`: Research on grammar rules and tonal structures.
* `/src`: The core application source code.
* `/locales`: JSON translation files for the app interface.
